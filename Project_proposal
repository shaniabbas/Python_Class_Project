Hydrological models are simplied, conceptual representation of a part of a
hydrological cycle. They are primary used for hydrologic prediction and for
understanding hydrologic processes.
As the temperature increases globally due to global warming the chances
for extreme events increases.Every year number of floods hit different parts
of the world due to extreme weather conditions (Heavy Precipitation, Hur-
ricane). This extreme weather conditions has forced scientists to develop
different hydrology models to predict extreme events before time.The mod-
els developed by scientists help us to
 Analyze the fooding problems in developed watersheds
 It also helps to find the change in magnitude of discharge, stage, or
volume to the probability or exceedance.
 Increase in flood damage in the watershed as a result of the development
of open area.
The software tool used for developing the hydrological models is ARCGIS
with HEC-GEOHMS and HEC-HMS extensions [Mahmood et al., 2016]
[Mahmood and Jia, 2016]. But these software tools are commerical (Pro-
prietary) charging alot of money for puschasing them. 
In this project I will be designing an automated application(Desktop/Web Based) for developing hydro-
logical models with just few clicks. This project will helps us in saving our
time and resources while doing hydrological modelling.
